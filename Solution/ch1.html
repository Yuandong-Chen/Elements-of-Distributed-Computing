    <p>1.1 Give advantage and disadvantages of a parallel programming model over a distributed system (message based) model</p>
    <p>Ans:</p>
    <p>adv: more efficient on single machine, shared memory and global clock.</p>
    <p>disadv: hard to scale up to massive machines</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1.2 Compare the mechanisms for synchornization and communication in parallel programming languages and distributed programming languages.</p>
    <p>Ans:</p>
    <p>Sync in Distributed: Make Phase Lock, not efficient. Failed sometime, or may impossible without any upperbound.</p>
    <p>Communication in Distributed: message passing</p>
    <p>Sync in parallel: Global variable. (lock)</p>
    <p>Communication in parallel: Shared memory.</p>
